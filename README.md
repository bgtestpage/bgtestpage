<h1>Hi, I'm BG! <br/><a href="https://github.com/bgtestpage">Cybersecurity Graduate</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blaine-geiger-999b81329/">Entry Level Cybersecurity Professional</a></h1>

- <h3>Home Network and Cybersecurity Lab</h3>
  <p>This is a small lab that has given me hands on experience with many topics. These include subnetting, VLANs, firewall rules, IP assignments,
  DHCP, DNS, Virtualization, vulnerability scanning, host and network hardening to name a few. It has been a process, but it has taught me many
  valuable lessons. I have essentially recreated much of the virtual environment and machines that exist in our University lab. These include Kali
  Linux, Metasploit2, OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project), WebGoat, and Damn Vulnerable Web App. VMs that are meant to be hacked. This
  provides a safe environment to learn about security, vulnerabilities, and exploits. I will be able to use and upscale this rich learning environment
  long after I don't access to the school's resources. The best part is that I can say I have designed, constructed, and configured it all from the ground up.
  It is humble, but it is my first lab, and I am proud of the work I've done. It is still a work in progress, but a lot of the work is done and the documentation
  needs to be finalized and I will upload it here.</p>
