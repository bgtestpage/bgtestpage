<h1>Hi, I'm BG! <br/><a href="https://github.com/bgtestpage">Cybersecurity Graduate</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blaine-geiger-999b81329/">Entry Level Cybersecurity Professional</a></h1>

- <h3>Home Network and Cybersecurity Lab</h3>
  <p>This is a small lab with a simple design. I have gained hands-on experience with subnetting, VLANs, firewall rules, IP assignments,
  DHCP, DNS, virtualization, vulnerability scanning, and host/network hardening to name a few. It has been an intensive (sometimes frustrating) process, but it has taught me many
  valuable lessons. I have essentially recreated much of the virtual environment and machines that exist in my University's lab. These include Kali
  Linux, Metasploitable2, OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project), WebGoat, and Damn Vulnerable Web App. VMs that are meant to be hacked. This
  provides a safe environment to learn about security, vulnerabilities, exploits, and carry out controlled penetration testing. I will be able to use and upscale this rich learning environment
  long after I graduate and don't have access to the school's resources. The best part is that I can say I have designed, constructed, and configured it all from the ground up.
  It is a humble lab, but it is my first lab, and I am proud of the work I've done. It is still a work in progress, but the majority of the setup work is complete. The documentation
  simply needs to be finalized, and I will upload it here.</p>
